1)	What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe emp-ty state?
safe empty state is basically a fuse. When we created an object we have to set something to all its parameters, for example, all "0". So now, if we create an object and call it, 
the code will not break or show us strange output, but it will show us what we need. This is exactly what empty state is.

Could you define another state as the safe empty state? - I did not understand this question.
in case I did understand:
yes we can.


2)	Describe how you have minimized code duplication.
We have created passenger.cpp file with our constructors and other functions, so instead of rewriting code every time we need to display something, for example,
we just call display() function. Or to check if the date is not empty again we use 1 function instead of rewriting every time something.

3)	Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the pri-vate data of the object referenced in its parameter.
Because prototype of canTravelWith() is located inside the Passenger class. 

4)	What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) func-tion executes correctly?
I have used "strcpy" and to use it in matrix we need to "#include <cstring>". in VS 2017 we have to say "strcpy_s" instead.

5)	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I did not learn much, but I did strengthen my knowledge how to use .h files, prototypes, how to use constructor overloading and how to minimize my code by creating own functions to check whatever I need.
P.s. also I learned CPP functions like "strcpy" and "strlen"
