1)	Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
to reduce redundancy movements. We do not need to copy anything, if that is already exists

2)	List how you avoided duplication of code.
using operator overloading I wrote the logic only once, and in the client code, I was just saying "+=" or "=" instead of writing this logic every time. Same thing for "display" and "isEmpty" functions

3)	List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
I have learned how to use operator overloading, and that Matrix is super old and does not work the same as you test the code on school pc.
