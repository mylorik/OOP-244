1.	What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.
An error, cannot compile. To make it work, compiler have to see the "template" and the "implementation" at the same time, in 1 file, if we move it to .cpp, compiler does not see it at the same time, 
and gives as an error.

2.	Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?
Its not working. We need to define it ABOVE main();

3.	Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates? 
Yes, I could. The main advantage is much clearer and easier to read, it can take any type and we dont have to type a new overloading for a new type, we need to write it only once

4.	Are the following equivalent? 
template<class T> 
template<typename T> 
Yes.
